This is a demo application showcasing the use of the
[Eventsourced library](https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced) for implementing the Event Sourcing (and
Command Sourcing), CQRS, and Memory Image patterns with Akka actors.

It makes use of the MongoDB journal based on ReactiveMongo for its event store, so you need to run a local MongoDB.

To run the application: 'sbt run'
